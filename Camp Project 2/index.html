            <h2 class="info-heading">Introduction</h2>
            <p>General Radahn, also known as Starscourge Radahn, stands as one of the most legendary warriors in the Lands Between. A towering figure, both in stature and in legacy, he once ruled the skies and the stars, holding them in a stalemate with his unmatched gravitational power. His tale is one of great might, tragedy, and an unwavering desire to protect his beloved realm.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2 class="info-heading">Early Life and Rise to Power</h2>
            <p>Radahn was born into the royal family of Caria, the son of Queen Rennala and King Radagon. From an early age, his potential for greatness was clear, as he trained under the guidance of the most powerful mages and warriors in the land. However, it was his obsession with strength that truly set him apart. Inspired by the legendary Godfrey, Radahn sought to become the greatest warrior of the age.<br><br>Radahn’s affinity for gravitational magic came under the tutelage of an Alabaster Lord, allowing him to wield the power of the cosmos itself. As he grew in strength, he became the General of his army, riding his beloved steed Leonard, a small horse Radahn had mastered gravity magic to continue riding despite his enormous size. His might was so unparalleled that he was able to hold the very stars in their orbits, preventing them from falling into the Lands Between.</p><hr>
            <h2 class="info-heading">The Shattering</h2>
            <p>During the time of the Shattering, when the demigods waged war for control over the Elden Ring, General Radahn’s role was crucial. His conquest of the Caelid region and his battles against the other demigods cemented his status as one of the most feared and respected leaders. However, Radahn's story took a tragic turn when he was afflicted by the Scarlet Rot, a deadly plague that gnawed at both his mind and body. Despite his condition, Radahn’s willpower remained, as he continued to hold the stars at bay, preventing untold disaster from befalling the world.</p><hr>
            <h2 class="info-heading">Legacy</h2>
            <p>General Radahn’s legend lived on even as his body and mind decayed. His warriors and admirers, unable to accept the demise of their once-great leader, created the Radahn Festival—a grand event where warriors from across the lands could face Radahn in battle. This tribute to the fallen general was not only a celebration of his martial prowess but a final honor to the man who fought to protect the Lands Between from cosmic devastation.<br><br>Despite the tragic end to his life, General Radahn remains a symbol of unyielding strength, dedication, and sacrifice. His mastery over the stars and his stalwart defense against the horrors of the world earned him a place among the greatest figures in the history of the Lands Between.</p>
